"""P1-4D Authorization Hardening Tests.

Tests for authorization enforcement independent of database RLS.
These tests verify that:
- Users can only access their own resources (missions, workers, approvals, etc.)
- Cross-user access is blocked (404 Not Found to avoid information leakage)
- Forged ownership fields in requests are ignored/overridden
- Anonymous access is denied
- Ownership transfer attempts are blocked
